First index is\nthe wheel diameter, second index is the wheelbase width. Read the clawbot programming tutorial\nfor more information behind the meaning of these two numbers.\n\nThe wheelbase diameter is the center-to-center distance between the wheels (center-to-center\nmeaning the width between the centers of both wheels). For example, if you are using four inch\nomni wheels and there are 11.5 inches between the centers of each wheel, you would call the\nconstructor like so:\n  ChassisScales scales({4_in, 11.5_in});\n\n                            Wheel diameter\n\n                             +-+\n                             | |\n                             v v\n\n                    +--->    ===             ===\n                    |         +               +\n                    |        ++---------------++\n                    |        |                 |\n   Wheelbase Width  |        |                 |\n                    |        |                 |\n                    |        |                 |\n                    |        ++---------------++\n                    |         +               +\n                    +--->    ===             ===\n\n\n@param  iwheelbase {wheel diameter, wheelbase width}","declarations":[],"spell":"66:3-66:16|2|2|2","extent":"66:3-72:4|2|2|0","declaring_type":2,"bases":[],"derived":[],"vars":[7,8],"uses":[],"callees":["67:26-67:41|1|3|288","67:26-67:41|1|3|288","68:25-68:27|2|3|32","69:26-69:28|2|3|32","70:57-70:64|6|3|32","70:75-70:78|4|3|32","71:27-71:34|6|3|32","71:58-71:65|6|3|32"]},{"id":6,"usr":5184963326651177309,"detailed_name":"","short_name_offset":0,"short_name_size":0,"kind":0,"storage":0,"hover":"","comments":"","declarations":[],"bases":[],"derived":[],"vars":[],"uses":["70:57-70:64|5|3|32","71:27-71:34|5|3|32","71:58-71:65|5|3|32"],"callees":[]},{"id":7,"usr":925014348131322181,"detailed_name":"void okapi::ChassisScales::~ChassisScales() noexcept","short_name_offset":27,"short_name_size":14,"kind":6,"storage":1,"hover":"","comments":"","declarations":[],"spell":"74:11-74:25|2|2|2","extent":"74:3-74:37|2|2|0","declaring_type":2,"bases":[],"derived":[],"vars":[],"uses":[],"callees":[]}],"vars":[{"id":0,"usr":6941730216275445878,"detailed_name":"const std::initializer_list<double> &iscales","short_name_offset":37,"short_name_size":7,"hover":"","comments":"","declarations":[],"spell":"27:54-27:61|0|3|2","extent":"27:17-27:61|0|3|0","type":4,"uses":["28:29-28:36|0|3|4"],"kind":253,"storage":1},{"id":1,"usr":9669875316765335677,"detailed_name":"std::vector<double> vec","short_name_offset":20,"short_name_size":3,"hover":"std::vector<double> vec(iscales)","comments":"","declarations":[],"spell":"28:25-28:28|0|3|2","extent":"28:5-28:37|0|3|0","type":5,"uses":["29:16-29:19|0|3|4","30:12-30:15|0|3|4"],"kind":13,"storage":1},{"id":2,"usr":2973422321918628916,"detailed_name":"double okapi::ChassisScales::straight","short_name_offset":29,"short_name_size":8,"hover":"","comments":"","declarations":[],"spell":"76:10-76:18|2|2|2","extent":"76:3-76:18|2|2|0","type":6,"uses":["29:5-29:13|0|3|4","31:29-31:37|0|3|4","70:5-70:13|5|3|4"],"kind":8,"storage":0},{"id":3,"usr":14015596290847350202,"detailed_name":"double okapi::ChassisScales::turn","short_name_offset":29,"short_name_size":4,"hover":"","comments":"","declarations":[],"spell":"77:10-77:14|2|2|2","extent":"77:3-77:14|2|2|0","type":6,"uses":["30:5-30:9|0|3|4","32:22-32:26|0|3|4","71:5-71:9|5|3|4"],"kind":8,"storage":0},{"id":4,"usr":2191871370701570127,"detailed_name":"okapi::QLength okapi::ChassisScales::wheelDiameter","short_name_offset":37,"short_name_size":13,"hover":"","comments":"","declarations":[],"spell":"78:11-78:24|2|2|2","extent":"78:3-78:24|2|2|0","type":7,"uses":["31:5-31:18|0|3|4","32:29-32:42|0|3|4","68:5-68:18|5|3|4","70:43-70:56|5|3|4","71:44-71:57|5|3|4"],"kind":8,"storage":0},{"id":5,"usr":12131951551507577745,"detailed_name":"","short_name_offset":0,"short_name_size":0,"hover":"","comments":"","declarations":[],"uses":["31:49-31:54|0|3|4","70:65-70:70|5|3|4","71:35-71:40|5|3|4","71:66-71:71|5|3|4"],"kind":0,"storage":0},{"id":6,"usr":15582860508871315826,"detailed_name":"okapi::QLength okapi::ChassisScales::wheelbaseWidth","short_name_offset":37,"short_name_size":14,"hover":"","comments":"","declarations":[],"spell":"79:11-79:25|2|2|2","extent":"79:3-79:25|2|2|0","type":7,"uses":["32:5-32:19|0|3|4","69:5-69:19|5|3|4","71:12-71:26|5|3|4"],"kind":8,"storage":0},{"id":7,"usr":17112820675738180575,"detailed_name":"const std::initializer_list<QLength> &iwheelbase","short_name_offset":38,"short_name_size":10,"hover":"","comments":"","declarations":[],"spell":"66:55-66:65|5|3|2","extent":"66:17-66:65|5|3|0","type":4,"uses":["67:30-67:40|5|3|4"],"kind":253,"storage":1},{"id":8,"usr":13758960118268569707,"detailed_name":"std::vector<QLength> vec","short_name_offset":21,"short_name_size":3,"hover":"std::vector<QLength> vec(iwheelbase)","comments":"","declarations":[],"spell":"67:26-67:29|5|3|2","extent":"67:5-67:41|5|3|0","type":5,"uses":["68:21-68:24|5|3|4","69:22-69:25|5|3|4"],"kind":13,"storage":1}]}
