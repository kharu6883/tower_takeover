If the given port has not\npreviously been configured as a gyro, then this function starts a 1300ms\ncalibration period.\n\nIt is highly recommended that an ADIGyro object be created in initialize()\nwhen the robot is stationary to ensure proper calibration. If an ADIGyro\nobject is declared at the global scope, a hardcoded 1300ms delay at the\nbeginning of initialize will be necessary to ensure that the gyro's\nreturned values are correct at the beginning of autonomous/opcontrol.\n\nThis function uses the following values of errno when an error state is\nreached:\nEINVAL - The given value is not within the range of ADI Ports\nEACCES - Another resource is currently trying to access the ADI.\n\n\\param port\n       The ADI port to initialize as a gyro (from 1-8, 'a'-'h', 'A'-'H')\n\\param multiplier\n       A scalar value that will be multiplied by the gyro heading value\n       supplied by the ADI","declarations":[{"spell":"500:2-500:9|19|2|1","param_spellings":["500:23-500:27","500:36-500:46"]}],"declaring_type":19,"bases":[],"derived":[],"vars":[],"uses":[],"callees":[]},{"id":22,"usr":360733270095585331,"detailed_name":"void pros::ADIGyro::~ADIGyro() noexcept","short_name_offset":20,"short_name_size":8,"kind":6,"storage":1,"hover":"","comments":"","declarations":[{"spell":"502:2-502:10|19|2|1","param_spellings":[]}],"declaring_type":19,"bases":[1],"derived":[],"vars":[],"uses":[],"callees":[]},{"id":23,"usr":17994133325688680133,"detailed_name":"double pros::ADIGyro::get_value() const","short_name_offset":22,"short_name_size":9,"kind":6,"storage":1,"hover":"","comments":"\nGets the current gyro angle in tenths of a degree.
